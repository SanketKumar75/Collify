\section{Limitations}
This project was a great experience for me but also has some limitations. First of all building everything from scratch was not possible, so I had to use external API's for some features which however is considered to be a good practice.

Secondly, as easy it was to avail a resource it was quite a challenge to integrate all the individual thing together in one working system.

Finally the scale of the project was to big for 2 months of time.
